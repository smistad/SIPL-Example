About
==================
This is an example of how to use the Simple Image Processing Library (see [www.github.com/smistad/SIPL/](www.github.com/smistad/SIPL/)).


Note: When you download the code, the content of the SIPL folder will be empty. This is a bug in GitHub and you must download the SIPL library separately from [www.github.com/smistad/SIPL/](www.github.com/smistad/SIPL/) and put the content inside the SIPL folder (don't worry it is easy).

Compile/Usage
=================
Use the CMakeLists.txt file to compile the example
